### Project Title
Version Control Project

### Description
The project is about the efficient use of version control and  cleaning the code to make it leaner and more efficient, and to overall improve the design of the code without impacting the external functionality of the code.It is also about mastering the use of the git tool and github, how to work with an existing repository. I will use my local git repository and my GitHub repository to Fork a repository, work on files, stage files and commit them to GitHub.
